Perfect! I've completed a comprehensive analysis of your entire application and created a detailed Backend Architecture Document (BACKEND_ARCHITECTURE.md) that covers everything you need to implement the backend for your stock trading app.

ðŸ“‹ Summary of What I've Documented:

1. Complete Database Schema (14 tables)
â€¢  User authentication & profiles
â€¢  Portfolio management
â€¢  Stock data & prices
â€¢  Watchlists
â€¢  Alert system
â€¢  Notifications
â€¢  AI insights
â€¢  Transactions

2. All API Endpoints (100+ endpoints)
â€¢  Authentication: 13 endpoints (login, register, social auth, biometric)
â€¢  User Management: 13 endpoints (profile, settings, preferences)
â€¢  Portfolio: 12 endpoints (holdings, transactions, performance)
â€¢  Stock Data: 15 endpoints (prices, charts, news, analysis)
â€¢  Watchlist: 6 endpoints
â€¢  Alerts: 10 endpoints
â€¢  Notifications: 8 endpoints
â€¢  AI Insights: 9 endpoints
â€¢  Discovery: 7 endpoints
â€¢  News: 7 endpoints

3. Technology Stack Recommendations
â€¢  Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript (recommended)
â€¢  Database: PostgreSQL + Redis + TimescaleDB
â€¢  Real-time: WebSockets / Server-Sent Events
â€¢  Third-party APIs: Stock data, AI, notifications, auth

4. Real-time Features
â€¢  WebSocket implementation for live prices
â€¢  Alert monitoring
â€¢  Push notifications
â€¢  Portfolio updates

5. State Management Architecture
â€¢  Redux Toolkit store structure
â€¢  API client setup with interceptors
â€¢  Service layer patterns

6. 14-Week Implementation Plan
â€¢  Phase-by-phase breakdown
â€¢  Clear priorities and dependencies
â€¢  Testing and deployment strategies

7. Security Considerations
â€¢  JWT authentication
â€¢  Data encryption
â€¢  API security
â€¢  Financial data compliance

8. Cost Estimation
â€¢  Monthly costs: $900-2900
â€¢  Breakdown by service

ðŸŽ¯ Key Features Mapped from Your UI:

Every button and field in your app has been mapped to backend functionality:

1. Login/SignUp: Full auth flow with social login
2. Dashboard: Portfolio data, AI insights, quick stats
3. Stock Analysis: Real-time prices, charts, news
4. Alerts: Create, manage, trigger notifications
5. Watchlist: Add/remove stocks, real-time updates
6. AI Insights: Predictions, recommendations, analysis
7. Notifications: Push, email, in-app
8. Search: Stock search, discovery, trending
9. Profile/Settings: User preferences, notification settings
10. Biometric: Face ID/Touch ID support

ðŸš€ Next Steps:

1. Choose your tech stack from the recommendations
2. Set up the backend project with the suggested structure
3. Start with Phase 1: Authentication & core infrastructure
4. Integrate a stock data API (Alpha Vantage, Polygon.io, or Yahoo Finance)
5. Implement the database schema using the provided SQL
6. Build the API endpoints following the documented structure
7. Add real-time features with WebSockets
8. Integrate AI services for insights and predictions

The document provides everything you need to build a production-ready backend that fully supports all the features in your beautiful UI. Each component's functionality has been mapped to specific API endpoints and database tables, ensuring nothing is missed.

Would you like me to help you get started with any specific part of the implementation, such as setting up the backend project structure or implementing specific API endpoints?

## ðŸŽ¯ Prompt 1: Overall Architecture & Technology Stack

```
I'm building a Node.js + TypeScript backend for an iOS stock trading app. I've uploaded 4 detailed reference files about my requirements and current implementation status.

**Project Context & Constraints:**
- Target: iOS app initially, considering web/Android expansion later
- Performance: Prioritizing sub-200ms latency for real-time updates over pure cost efficiency
- Infrastructure: Open to both serverless/microservices (AWS Lambda, GCP Cloud Run) and traditional VM/container deployments
- Redis: Considering managed solutions (AWS ElastiCache) vs self-hosted based on cost/performance trade-offs
- Scale: Must handle 1000+ concurrent users with real-time portfolio calculations
- Budget: Startup budget but willing to invest in performance-critical components

Based on these files and constraints, please:

1. **Technology Stack Recommendations**: Analyze my current tech stack (Node.js, Express, PostgreSQL, Redis) and recommend the best 2024 alternatives or improvements, especially for:
   - Stock data APIs (free vs paid options with sub-200ms latency requirements)
   - Real-time WebSocket architecture (Socket.io vs native WebSocket vs Server-Sent Events)
   - Database optimization for financial data (PostgreSQL vs TimescaleDB vs hybrid approach)
   - Caching strategies for high-frequency trading data (Redis clustering vs single instance)

2. **Architecture Decisions**: Given that I'm at 15% implementation and may expand to web later, should I:
   - Stick with monolithic architecture or move to microservices/serverless?
   - Use GraphQL instead of REST for complex financial queries (considering mobile-first but web expansion)?
   - Implement event-driven architecture with message queues (AWS SQS vs Redis pub/sub)?
   - Choose between traditional hosting vs serverless for different components?

3. **Modern Implementation Patterns**: What are the latest 2024/2025 best practices for:
   - JWT authentication with refresh token rotation (considering mobile-first design)
   - Financial data validation and error handling (real-time constraints)
   - Real-time portfolio calculation engines (sub-second performance requirements)
   - Multi-channel notification systems (iOS push, email, SMS integration)

4. **Infrastructure & Hosting Strategy**: Considering my constraints, what's the optimal approach for:
   - Managed vs self-hosted Redis (AWS ElastiCache vs Redis Cloud vs self-managed)
   - Serverless components (which parts benefit from Lambda/Cloud Functions)
   - Database hosting (managed PostgreSQL vs self-hosted vs cloud-native solutions)
   - CDN and edge computing for global low-latency access

5. **Priority Implementation Order**: Based on my roadmap and performance requirements, which components should I implement first for an MVP that can handle:
   - 1000+ concurrent users with sub-200ms response times
   - Real-time stock price updates with WebSocket streaming
   - Portfolio tracking with sub-second calculations
   - Smart alert system with multi-channel delivery

Please provide specific library recommendations, cost analysis, performance benchmarks, and implementation strategies based on the current state described in my files and the constraints above.

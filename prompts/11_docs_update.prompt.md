# Task: Documentation Updates

Scope:
- Keep docs in sync with code changes for endpoints and features

Read first:
- README.md, WARP.md, ARCHITECTURE.md, COMPONENT_BACKEND_MAPPING.md, DATA_FLOWS.md, BACKEND_IMPLEMENTATION_ROADMAP.md

Implement:
1) Update README with new endpoints and quick-start changes
2) Update WARP.md with any new commands or flows
3) Update DATA_FLOWS.md with adjusted sequences
4) Update COMPONENT_BACKEND_MAPPING.md statuses

Acceptance Criteria:
- Docs reflect reality post-implementation
- New contributors can follow docs and run app end-to-end
